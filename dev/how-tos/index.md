# Welcome to Idiomatic JSCore

The repository of JSCore packages allows common tasks such as [creating commands](./register-commands) and [listening to events](./listen-to-events) to be done declaratively in the expressive coding style of JavaScript.

These packages are written with JSCore in mind, so operations such as restarting JSCore will not lead to issues that will otherwise happen if FabricMC methods are used directly without a suitable design.

Idiomatic JSCore is the preferred way of writing code. If there is anything you are doing which is not covered here, join the [**JSCore Discord**](https://discord.gg/XfSZ5tc7Sk) to suggest a guide.
