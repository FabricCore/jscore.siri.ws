# Welcome to Idiomatic JSCore

The expanding repository of JSCore packages allows common tasks such as [creating commands](./register-commands) and [listening to events](./listen-to-events) to be done declaratively, as opposed to the FabricMC way of doing things.

These packages are themselves too, written entirely in JSCore flavoured JavaScript. If you have experience in FabricMC, we too could get involved in the project by joining the [**JSCore Discord**](https://discord.gg/XfSZ5tc7Sk).
