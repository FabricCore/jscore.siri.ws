# Introduction

Read the [**Quickstart Guide**](/player/quickstart.html) to setup JSCore before reading **JSCore for Developers**.

### A Brief Rundown

If you're reading this, it probably means you want to learn how to modify Minecraft with JSCore. Awesome! You've come to the right place. This guide will teach you things such as:

- How to setup and run [your first JSCore package](./basics/first-package).
- How to create and handle [commands]().
- [Listening to events](), and automated tasks.
- And much more...

### Recommendations

To create a module with JSCore, you should have a fairly decent grasp of JavaScript itself. While you *can* make a module with very little JavaScript and programming knowledge, trying to do so without understanding the language first will only hinder you.

If you don't know JavaScript but would like to learn it, here are some useful resources:
- [Eloquent JavaScript, a free online book](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) (Section 1 - 6)
- [~~Google~~ DuckDuckGo, your best friend](https://duckduckgo.com)

And perhaps most importantly, the [**JSCore Discord**](https://discord.gg/WAR9aKVFQJ). Where we are more than happy to help you with any problems you encountered along the way.
